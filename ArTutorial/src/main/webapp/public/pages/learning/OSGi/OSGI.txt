BundleActivator is an interface provided by OSGi that has to be implemented by classes that are entry points for a bundle.

The start() method is invoked by the OSGi platform when the bundle containing this class is started. On the other hand stop() is invoked before just before the bundle is stopped.

To create a bundle set <packaging>bundle</packaging> in pom.xml


Go to karaf/bin folder and execute below commands
1. karaf start
2. bundle:install mvn:{groupId}/{artifactId}/{version} 
e.g. bundle:install mvn:com.arsoft.projects/test/1.0.0
This will give bundle id
3. bundle:start {bundleId} to start bundle
4. list command to get list of installed bundles
5. install -s mvn:org.json/json/20180813 installs and starts a bundle
6. bundle:stop {bundleId}  to stop bundle
