<h1>Machine learning</h1>
<h1>Features</h1>
<p></p>
<h2>Data Mining</h2>
<ul>
	<li>It is the practice of examining large pre-existing databases in order to generate new information.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bayesian inference</h2>
<ul>
	<li>It is a statistical paradigm that answers research questions about unknown parameters using probability statements.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Machine learning</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The term "machine learning" was coined in 1959 by Arthur Lee Samuel</li>
	<li>It is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.</li>
	<li>It deals with programming the computer systems to make them learn and improve with data and experience.</li>
	<li>Learning means recognizing and understanding the input data and decisions based on the supplied data.</li>
	<li>It is used in various fields such as:
		<ul>
			<li>Vision processing</li>
			<li>Language processing</li>
			<li>Forecasting </li>
			<li>Pattern recognition</li>
			<li>Games</li>
			<li>Data mining</li>
			<li>Expert systems</li>
			<li>Robotics</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Steps involved are:
		<ul>
			<li>Defining a Problem</li>
			<li>Preparing Data</li>
			<li>Evaluating Algorithms</li>
			<li>Improving Results</li>
			<li>Presenting Results</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.</li>
	<li>The goal of machine learning is never to make "perfect" guesses, because it deals in domains where there is no such thing. The goal is to make guesses that are good enough to be useful.</li>
	<li><b>Predictor Function</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Mathematically for machine learning, the goal is to devise a mathematical function h(x) called <b>predictor or hypothesis.</b> <b>Learning</b> consists of using sophisticated mathematical algorithms to optimize this function so that, given input data x about a certain domain, it will accurately predict some interesting value h(x). Example:<br/> 
		<b>h(x) = &theta;<sub>0</sub> +  &theta;<sub>1</sub> * x</b></li>
			<li>&theta;<sub>0</sub> and &theta;<sub>1</sub> are called coefficients/parameters of the predictor function.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Cost Function or Loss Function</b>
		<ul>
			<li>The wrongness measure in estimating the almost accurate value of predictor function h(x) is known as the <b>cost function or loss function</b>.Example:<br/>
			<b>J(&theta;<sub>0</sub>,  &theta;<sub>1</sub>) = 1/2m &Sigma; (h(x<sub>t,i</sub>) - y)<sup>2</sup></b> where i ranges from 1 to m</li>
			<li>The ultimate goal of machine learning is to find the coefficients for predictor h(x) such that our cost function J (&theta;<sub>0</sub>,  &theta;<sub>1</sub>) is as small as possible.The power of calculus is used to accomplish this.</li>
			<li>The cost function when plotted against the values of &theta;<sub>0</sub> and &theta;<sub>1</sub> gives a bowl shaped plot.
				<ul>
					<li><img src="../../images/costFunction.jpg" alt="cost function" height="400" width="100%"/></li>
					<li>Any random point on the bowl plot gives the cost of the current values of the coefficients</li>
					<li>The bottom of the bowl is the cost of the best set of coefficients, the minimum of the function.</li>
					<li>The goal is to continue to try different values for the coefficients, evaluate their cost and select new coefficients that have a slightly better (lower) cost. Repeating this process enough times will lead to the bottom of the bowl and you will know the values of the coefficients that result in the minimum cost.</li>
				</ul>
			</li> 
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Gradient Descent</b>
		<ul>
			<li>It is an optimization algorithm used to find the values of parameters (coefficients) of a predictor function <b>(h(x))</b> that minimizes the cost function <b>(J (&theta;<sub>0</sub>,  &theta;<sub>1</sub>) )</b>.</li>
			<li>This is used when the parameters can not be calculated using linear equations.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Classifier</b>
		<ul>
			<li>It is a supervised algorithm which is used in classification of large volume of data to solve problems using machine learning.</li>
			<li>It maps the input data to a specific category.</li>
			<li>Few classifiers are:
				<ul>
					<li><b>Perceptron</b></li>
					<li><b>Naive Bayes</b></li>
					<li><b>Decision Tree</b></li>
					<li><b>Logistic Regression</b></li>
					<li><b>K-Nearest Neighbor</b></li>
					<li><b>Artificial Neural Networks/Deep Learning</b></li>
					<li><b>Support Vector Machine</b></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Confusion Matrix</b>
		<ul>
			<li>It is a technique to measure the performance of a classifier algorithm.</li>
			<li>It gives the count as well as the types of error being made by a classifier algorithm.</li>
			<li>A table is created with columns as the actual class and rows as the predicted class
				<table border="1">
					<tr><th colspan="2" rowspan = "2">Confusion matrix</th><th colspan="2">Predicted Class</th></tr>
					<tr><td><b>On</b></td><td><b>Off</b></td></tr>
					<tr><td rowspan = "2"><b>Actual Class</b></td><td><b>On</b></td><td>42</td><td>8</td></tr>
					<tr><td><b>Off</b></td><td>18</td><td>32</td></tr>
				</table>
			</li>
			<li>The above table says
				<ul>
					<li>The classifier correctly identified On as On in 42 cases.</li>
					<li>The classifier incorrectly identified On as Off in 8 cases.</li>
					<li>The classifier correctly identified Off as Off in 32 cases</li>
					<li>The classifier incorrectly identified Off as On in 18 cases</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Classification Accuracy: </b>
		<ul>
			<li>It is the ratio of correct predictions to total predictions. <br/>
		<b>classification accuracy = correct predictions / total predictions</b></li>
			<li>Misclassification/error rate: <br/>
				<b>misclassification rate = (1 - classification accuracy) * 100</b>
			</li>
			<li>For the table mentioned in <b>confusion matrix</b> section<br/>
				<b>classification accuracy = (42 + 32) / (42 + 8 + 32 + 18) = 74/100 = 0.74</b><br/>
				<b>misclassification/error rate = (1 - 0.74 ) * 100 = 26</b>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Sigmoid Function</b>
		<ul>
			<li>It is a mathematical function having S shaped curve</li>
			<li><img src="../../images/sigmoid.jpg" alt="sigmoid function" height="400" width="100%"/></li>
			<li>Mathematically it is represented as <br/>
			<b>S(x) = 1 / (1 + e <sup>x</sup>)</b></li>
			<li>The output boundaries of this function are (0,1)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>Python as a Machine learning language</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Python and its libraries like NumPy, SciPy, IPython, Panda, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib are used in data science and data analysis.</li>
	<li>It implements popular machine learning techniques:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Classification</b>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Regression</b>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Recommendation</b>
			</li>
				<li><b>Clustering</b>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>It offers data mining tasks on large volumes of data using algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, Naive Bayes, k-means, k nearest neighbor, and random forest.</li>
	<li>We need to add few external libraries to python to use machine learning capabilities. The steps to install them are:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Install the required libraries from command prompt using command:<br/>
				<b>python -m pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib ipython jupyter pandas sympy nose sklearn scikit-learn preprocessing gym</b>
			</li>
			<li>
				Added the path of the installed scripts to path environment variable
			</li>
			<li>
				Upgrade pip installer using command<br/>
				<b>python -m pip install --user --upgrade pip</b>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>Categories of Machine Learning Algorithms</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>Supervised learning algorithm:</b> The program is "trained" on a pre-defined set of "training examples", which then facilitate its ability to reach an accurate conclusion when given new data. The training data for the algorithms is already labeled. Below are the two types of supervised learning algorithms:
		<ul>
			<li><b>Classification Algorithms:</b> 
				<ul>
					<li>These algorithms give an output having a discrete label. They are used in case a given problem has a solution within a finite set of possible outcomes. They can be further of below types
						<ul>
							<li><b>Binary Classification:</b> In case a problem can have only two possible outcomes e.g. determining whether an email is spam or not, if a candidate in an exam is a male or female.</li>
							<li><b>Multi-label Classification:</b> In case a problem can have more than two possible outcomes e.g. customer segmentation, audio and image categorization, and text analysis for mining customer sentiment.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Few examples of classification algorithms are Naive Bayes, decision trees, logistic regression, kernel approximation, and K-nearest neighbors.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><b>Regression Algorithms:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>These algorithms give an output which is unbounded. The outcome to a problem is represented by a quantity that is flexibly determined based on the inputs of the model rather than being confined to a set of possible labels e.g. predicting housing prices, likelihood of customers to churn, or the revenue a customer will generate. </li>
					<li>Few examples of regression algorithms are linear regression, regression trees and support vector regression.</li> 
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Un-supervised learning algorithm:</b> The program is given a bunch of data and it itself must find patterns and relationships therein.</li>
	<li><b>Semi-supervised learning algorithm:</b></li>
	<li><b>Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm:</b> 
		<ul>
			<li>The algorithm is based on interaction with environment. </li>
			<li>The program dynamically interacts with the environment and improves its performance on the basis of positive and negative feedback it receives.</li>
			<li>This involves the following 
				<ul>
					<li><b>Agent: </b>who performs all the tasks.</li>
					<li><b>Action: </b>Task performed by the agent.</li>
					<li><b>Environment: </b>Scenario faced by the agent. It is a modeled as a stochastic finite state machine with inputs (actions sent from the agent) and outputs (observations and rewards sent to the agent)</li>
					<li><b>Reward function: </b>Function used to train the agent how to perform the task.</li>
					<li><b>Internal state</b> State maintained by the agent to learn about the environment.</li>
					<li><b>Policy: </b>Strategy of choosing an action given a state in expectation of a better reward.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Some platforms associated with Reinforcement learning are:
				<ul>
					<li><b>Deepmind Lab</b></li>
					<li><b>OpenAI Gym: </b>
						<ul>
							<li>It is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.</li>
							<li>This is the gym open-source library, which gives you access to a standardized set of environments.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><b>OpenAI Universe</b></li>
					<li><b>Project Malmo</b></li>
					<li><b>VizDoom</b></li>
					<li><b>RL-Glue</b></li>
					<li><b>CommAI</b></li>
					<li><b>Burlap</b></li>
					<li><b>rlenvs</b></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Steps involved in Reinforcement learning are
				<ul>
					<li>Observation of the environment</li>
					<li>Deciding how to act using some strategy</li>
					<li>Acting accordingly</li>
					<li>Receiving a reward or penalty</li>
					<li>Learning from the experiences and refining the strategy</li>
					<li>Iterate until an optimal strategy is found</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Few examples of Reinforcement learning are driverless cars, self navigating vaccum cleaners, scheduling of elevators etc.</li>
