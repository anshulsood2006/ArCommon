<h1>Binary Tree</h1>
<h1>Features</h1>
<ul>
<li>The root element is created only once when the tree is empty</li>
<li>The next items are added as the left and right children. </li>
<li>The item having value less than the root is added as left child</li>
<li>The item having value greater than or equal the root is added as right child</li>
<li>Further elements are added as the left and the right children to the above nodes on the basis of same criteria</li>
<li>The tree can be traversed in three ways (on the basis of order in which root node is visited) 
	<ul>
		<li><b>In-order</b></li>
		<li><b>Pre-order</b></li>
		<li><b>Post-order</b></li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Algorithm</h1>
<h2>To create a binary tree</h2>
<pre>
Get the root node
if root node is null
	Add the given node as root node.
	exit
else if root node is not null
	Get the value of root node as parent node
	if value of new node is less than or equal to the value of parent node (Step 1)
		The new node needs to be added as left child
		If the parent node already has left child
			Make left child as parent node and go to step 1
		else if the parent node has no left child
			Add the node as child node
	else if value of new node is greater than the value of parent node
		The new node needs to be added as right child
		If the parent node already has right child
			Make right child as parent node and go to step 1
		else if the parent node has no right child
			Add the node as child node
</pre>

<pre>
Output = 

Get the root element as current element current = 12
Check if current has left child yes  4
put current element on stack [12]

Make left child as current element current = 4
Check if current has left child yes  1
put current element on stack [12, 4]

Make left child as current element current = 1
Check if current has left child no  null
put current element on stack [12, 4, 1]
Print value of current with no left child 1

 
Check if current has right child yes 3
put current element on stack [12, 4, 1, 3]
Make right child as current element current = 3

Check if current has left child yes  2
Make left child as current element current = 2
Check if current has left child yes  1
Make left child as current element current = 1
Check if current has left child no  null
Print value of current with no left child 1
Check if current has right child no null
Go back to previous current element current = 2
Print value of current 2
Check if current has right child no null
Go back to previous current element current = 3
Print value of current 3
Check if current has right child yes 3
Make right child as current element current = 3
Check if current has left child no  null
Print value of current with no left child 3
Check if current has right child no  null
Go back to previous current element current = 3
Go back to previous current element current = 1
