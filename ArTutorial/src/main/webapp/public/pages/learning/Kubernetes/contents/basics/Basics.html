<h1>Kubernetes</h1>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform developed by Google. It is an enhanced version of Borg tool which was used to manage both long running processes and batch jobs.</li>
	<li>It was donated to Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) by Google and thus became open source.</li>
	<li>It deals in automated deployment, scaling, running and monitoring of applications.</li>
	<li>It acts as a control loop as it compares the desired state to the actual state, and if they aren't the same, takes steps to correct it. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Components of Kubernetes</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Master Control Panel:</b> The component that performs orchestration. It has below sub components 
	<ul>
		<li><b>Etcd: </b>For storage of configuration information.</li>
		<li><b>API Server: </b>For communication between the components.</li>
		<li><b>Schedular: </b>For deciding the nodes where pods should run.</li>
		<li><b>Controller Manager: </b>For checking current state with desired state.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Pods:</b> The component that hold containers, most of the times a pod has one container. </li>
<li><b>Nodes:</b> The component where pods get scheduled. The applications actually run on the nodes.</li>
