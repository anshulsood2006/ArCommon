<h1>Features</h1>
<p><b>Bit</b></p>
<p>It stands for binary digit and is a basic unit of information used in computing and digital communications. </p>
<p><b>Byte</b></p>
<p>It is also a unit of information used in computing and digital communications and is equal to 8 bits.</p>
<p><b>Autoboxing</b></p>
<p>Convert primitive data types to corresponding Wrapper classes. This can be done in below ways:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Passing as a parameter to a method that expects an object of the corresponding wrapper class. For example a method with Integer argument can be called by passing int, java compiler will do the conversion of int to Integer.</li>
	<li>Assign to a variable of the corresponding wrapper class. For example, assigning a Long object to long variable.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Unboxing</b></p>	
<p>Convert  Wrapper classes to corresponding primitive data types. This can be done in below ways: </p>	
<ul>
 	<li>Pass as a parameter to a method that expects a value of the corresponding primitive type.</li>
	<li>Assign to a variable of the corresponding primitive type.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Association:</b></p>
<p>It is a type of HAS-A relationship between two classes. It is of two types:
<ol>
	<li><b>Aggregation: </b>It is a one way relationship between two classes. Both the entries can survive individually which means ending one entity will not effect the other entity.</li>
	<li><b>Composition: </b>Both the entities are dependent on each other. The composed object cannot exist without the other entity.</li>
</ol>
<p> <a href="Comparator&Comparable.html"><b>Comparator and Comparable: </b></a>These are the interfaces used to sort the object of a user defined collection.</p>

<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p><b>What is the difference between equals and ==?</b></p>
<ul>
<li> == is a operator while equals is a method in Java.</li>
<li> == behaves identical for all the objects where as equals being a method can be overridden to compare the objects based on business needs.</li>
<li> == can be used to compare both the primitives and objects where as the equals can be used to compare objects only</li>
<li>For primitives, == operator will return true only in case the values are same otherwise this will return false.</li>
<li>For objects, == operator will return true only if the memory reference is same for the objects  otherwise this will return false.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>What is result of program: </b></p>
<pre>
	Integer i3 = 100; 
	Integer i4 = 100; 
	if (i3 == i4) { 
		System.out.println("i1 and i2 is equal"); 
	} else { 
		System.out.println("i1 and i2 is not equal "); 
	}?
</pre>
<p>i1 and i2 is equal. This happens because auto boxing uses Integer.valueOf() method to convert Integer to int and since method caches Integer object for range -128 to 127, it return same Integer object in heap.</p>
<p><b>What is default return value for hashcode() method inside the Object class</b></p>
<p>The value returned by the default implementation of hashCode() is called identity hash code and it is by default the integer representation of the memory address of the object. However this implementation is JVM dependent. Even if the hashCode method is overridden, the identity hash code can be obtained for the object as System.identityHashCode(object)</p>
<p><b>What is the contract between equals and hashcode method in Java</b></p>
<p>Objects which are equals must also return the same hashcode. Both equals() and hashCode() methods are defined in the Object class as below:</p>
<ul>
	<li>public native int hashCode()</li>
	<li><pre>public boolean equals(Object obj) {
	return (this == obj);
}</pre></li>
</ul>
<p>As per the contract, whenever hashCode() method is invoked on the same object more than once during an execution of a Java application, the hashCode method must consistently return the same integer. But normally JVM will relocate the objects, after GC or compaction.</p>
<p><b>What is the difference between composition and aggregation?</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Aggregation implies a relationship where the child can exist independently of the parent. For example, Bank and Employee, delete the Bank and the Employee still exist. whereas Composition implies a relationship where the child cannot exist independent of the parent. Example: Human and heart, heart don't exist separate to a Human</li>
	<li>Aggregation relation is "has-a" and composition is ""part-of" relation.</li>
	<li>Composition is a strong association whereas aggregation is a weak association.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>What is the difference between local variable and member variable</b></p>
<p>A variable declared inside a method is called local variable while variable declared inside a class is called a member variable</p>
<p><b>What is the need of String pool in Java?</b></p>
<p>Since the strings are immutable in Java, so in order to save memory on creation of same string objects again and again, Java instead uses the string objects from string pool.</p>
<p><b>What other datatypes other than String are cached in Java?</b></p>
<p>If the value p being boxed is true, false, a byte, or a char in the range \u0000 to \u007f, or an int or short number between -128 and 127 (inclusive), then let r1 and r2 be the results of any two boxing conversions of p. It is always the case that r1 == r2.</p>
<p><b>In which memory area string pool is created in Java?</b></p>
<p>Heap Memory</p>
<p><b>What is the output of below program?
<pre>
	String a = "ab" +"c";
	String c = "a" + "bc";
	System.out.println("(a == c) is:  " + (a == c));
</pre></b></p>
<p>(a == c) is:  true</p>
<p><b></b></p>
