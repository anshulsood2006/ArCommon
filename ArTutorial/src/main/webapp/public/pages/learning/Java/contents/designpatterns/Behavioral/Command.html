<h1>Command Design Pattern</h1>
<h1>Features</h1>
<p>It is a type of behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to encapsulate all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time. This information includes the method name, the object that owns the method and values for the method parameters.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Create a command classes. A command is an object whose role is to store all the information required for executing an action, including the method to call, the method arguments, and the object (known as the receiver) that owns the method.</li>
	<li>Create a receiver class. A receiver is an object that performs a set of actions</li>
	<li>Create the invoker class. An invoker is an object that knows how to execute a given command but doesn't know how the command has been implemented.</li>
	<li>Create the client class. A client is an object that controls the command execution process by specifying what commands to execute and at what stages of the process to execute them.</li>
