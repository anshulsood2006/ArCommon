<h1>Lock</h1>
<h1>Features</h1>
<ul>
<li>It is an interface defined inside the java.util.concurrent.lock package </li>
<li>It has below methods
	<ul>
		<li>lock(): To acquire the lock</li>
		<li>unlock(): To release the lock</li>
		<li>tryLock(): To wait for lock for specified period</li>
		<li>newCondition(): To create a condition.</li>
	</ul>	
</li>
<li>The lock() method locks the Lock instance so that all threads calling lock() are blocked until unlock() is executed.
	<pre>
		public class Counter{

		  	private Lock lock = new Lock();
		  	private int count = 0;
		
		  	public int inc(){
			    <b>lock.lock();
			    try{
			    	int newCount = ++count;
			    }finally{
			    	lock.unlock();</b>
		    	    }
			    return newCount;
		  	}
		}
		
		//Re-entrant Lock
		public class Lock{

			private boolean isLocked = false;
			private Thread  lockedBy = null;
 			private int lockedCount = 0;
			
			public synchronized void lock() throws InterruptedException{
				Thread callingThread = Thread.currentThread();
				while(isLocked && lockedBy != callingThread){
				    wait();
				}
				isLocked = true;
				lockedCount++;
    			lockedBy = callingThread
			}
			
			public synchronized void unlock(){
				if(Thread.curentThread() == this.lockedBy){
					 lockedCount--;
					 if(lockedCount == 0){
			  				isLocked = false;
			  				notify();
	  				 }
				}
			}
	</pre>
	Here all the threads are blocked once lock.lock() is getting called and are released once unlock is called.
</li>
<li>The above Lock class is re-entrant as well since if a thread already holds the lock on a monitor object, it has access to all blocks synchronized on the same monitor object.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Difference between Lock and synchronized</p>
<ul>
<li>synchronized is used within a single method where as lock on an object can be obtained and closed in different methods</li>
<li>synchronized does not support fairness where as fairness can be provided as boolean parameter in the constructor of the lock class to grant access to the longest-waiting thread.</li>
<li>A thread is blocked if it does not get access to synchronized block where as lock api is having a tryLock() method which makes sure that thread acquires lock only if it's available and not held by any other thread.</li>
</ul>
