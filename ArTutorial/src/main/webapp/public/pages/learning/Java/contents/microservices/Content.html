<h1>Microservices</h1>
<h2>Features of a Microservice</h2>
<ul>
<li>It is a service oriented architecture of software development.</li>
<li>It is a software architecture wherein each component of an application is build as an independent autonomous service.</li>
<li>Each microservice performs a unique business goal.</li>	
<li>The microservices communicate with each other in stateless mode where each request/response is independent of the other.</li>
<li>The microservices are exposed by REST.</li>
<li>Various microservices communicate with each other by using lightweight protocols such as HTTP or REST or messaging protocols</li>
<li>A microservice can be created using Spring Boot in Java.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Features of a Microservice</h2>
<ul>
<li>A microservice never serves more than one responsibility.</li>
<li>A microservice never restricts itself from accepting appropriate technology stack or database. </li>
<li>A microservice failure never causes complete failure of large application. Only affected module gets impacted.</li>
<li>A microservice is always automatically deployable.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p><b>What is monolithic architecture?</b></p>
<p><ul>
<li>It is a software architecture wherein all the components of an application are packaged into single package.</li>
<li>All the code is deployed on a single server</li>
<li>To scale the application multiple instances of server are created.</li>
</ul></p>
<p><b>What are the differences between monolitic and microservice architecture?</b></p>
<p><table border="1">
<tr><th>Monolithic</th><th>Microservice</th></tr>
<tr><td>A single code base for all the business objective.</td><td>Each business goal is delivered by an individual microservice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Application takes much time to start.</td><td>Each microservice takes very less time to start.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Since code is tightly coupled, changes are difficult to do.</td><td>Since code is loosely coupled, changes are rather easy to do.</td></tr>
<tr><td>If a feature is not working whole application needs to be rebuild after fix. The complete system goes down, so fault isolation is difficult.</td><td>If a feature is not working, only that microservice needs to be rebuild after fix. The complete system does not go down, so fault isolation is easy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Resources need to be added to complete application for scaling purpose.</td><td>Resources need to be added to the only that microservice server where load is high.</td></tr>
<tr><td>The development and management is tough as the team size is comparatively large.</td><td>The development and management is easy as the team size is small.</td></tr>
<tr><td>The complete application is build on one technology only.</td><td>Different technologies can be used for different microservices</td></tr>
<tr><td>Change in data model affects the entire database.</td><td>Change in data model affects the database model for that particular webservice only.</td></tr>

<p><b>What is Service Virtualization?</b></p>
<p>It is the method to emulate the behaviour of microservice for testing purpose so they one component can be tested even when the other key components are not ready.</p>
