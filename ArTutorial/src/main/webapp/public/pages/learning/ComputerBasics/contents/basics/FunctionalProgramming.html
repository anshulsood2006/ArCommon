<h1>Functional Programming</h1>
<h1>Features</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Everything is a mathematical function.</li>
	<li>The programs are executed by evaluating expressions inside functions.</li>
	<li>There is a complete separation between the data of a program, and the behaviors of a program</li>
	<li>All objects created in functional programming are immutable.</li>
	<li>Shared state is avoided.</li>
	<li>Adherence to pure functions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pure functions</h2>
A pure function is a function where:
<ul>
	<li>The return value only depends on the input. An input value always return the same value.</li>
	<li>There are no side effects which means there are no network or database calls which could alter the output.</li>
	<li>The input data is immutable.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Higher Order Function:</h2>
A higher order function is a function which:
<ul>
	<li>takes a functions as an input.</li>
	<li>returns a function as an output.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuple</h2>
<ul>
	<li>A tuple is a compound data type having a fixed number of terms.</li>
	<li>Each term in a tuple is known as an element.</li>
	<li>The number of elements is the size of the tuple.</li>
	<li>It is fixed in size and is immutable.</li>
	<li>It can contain elements of different types.</li>
	<li>It is denoted by round parenthesis around the elements e.g. (1, 2, 3, "Anshul").</li>
</ul></p>
<h2>Record</h2>
<p>A record is a data structure for storing a fixed number of elements.</p>
<h2>Lazy evaluation/Curring</h2>
<p>It is an evaluation strategy which holds the evaluation of an expression until its value is needed</p>
<h1>Examples</h1>
<p><b>Impure functions</b></p>
<pre>
	function number(num){
	  	num * Math.random()
	}
	The above function gives different result everytime.
	
	function hello(greeting){
	  	console.log(greeting)
	}
	The above function creates a side effect which is console logging.
	 
	var totalPeople = 10
	function totalVotes(votes){
	 	return votes * totalPeople
	}
	The above function depends on a variable outside the function.

	<tr><td>It prefers to keep data in plain arrays and/or hashes and not "complicate" data by mixing it with behavior.</td><td>It prefers to keep data in structured manner by using objects.</td></tr>
