<h1>Features</h1>
<h2>Derivative</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The derivative of a function of a real variable is the measures of its sensitivity to change its value (output value) with respect to a change in its argument (input value). </li>
	<li>It is calculated for a function of single variable.</li>
	<li>It is a scalar-valued function.</li>
	<li>Example:   the derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to time is the object's velocity: this measures how quickly the position of the object changes when time advances.</li>
	<li>The derivative of y with respect to x is written as <b>dy/dx</b></li>
</ul>
<h2>Gradient</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The gradient of a function of a real variable is the measures of its sensitivity to change its values (output value) with respect to a changes in its arguments (input value). </li>
	<li>It is calculated for a function of multiple variables.</li>
	<li>It is a vector-valued function.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Partial Derivative</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Partial Derivative of a function of several variables is its derivative with respect to one of those variables, with the others held constant</li>
	<li>For example for a function f(x,y,z) partial derivative with respect to x is denoted as <b>&delta;f/ &delta;x</b></li>
</ul>
<h2>Transpose</h2>
The transpose of a matrix is a new matrix whose rows are the columns of the original matrix.
