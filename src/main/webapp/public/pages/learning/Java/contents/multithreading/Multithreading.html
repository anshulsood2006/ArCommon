<h1>Multithreading</h1>
<h1>Features</h1>
<p><b>Types of thread: </b> </p>
<ul>
<li><b>User Threads: </b>They are high-priority threads. The JVM will wait for any user thread to complete its task before terminating it.</li>
<li><a href="DaemonThread.html"><b>Daemon Threads: </b></a>They are low-priority threads whose only role is to provide services to user threads.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Lifecycle of Thread:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>New:</b> This is the state when thread is created using new keyword.</li>
<li><b>Runnable:</b> This is the state when we call start method on the thread object.</li>
<li><b>Running:</b> This is the state when thread is executing.</li>
<li><b>Blocked/Waiting:</b> This is the state when we call join method on the thread object.</li>
<li><b>Dead:</b> This is the state when thread has completed its execution.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Thread Priority:</b> It is defined between 1 to 10 where 10 is the highest priority and the threads with higher priority will get executed first. But this depends on thread scheduler which is OS dependent. It is set by calling  setPriority(priority) method on thread object.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thread.MIN_PRIORITY is defined as 1</li>
<li>Thread.NORM_PRIORITY is defined as 5</li>
<li>Thread.MAX_PRIORITY is defined as 10</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Methods of thread class</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>Non Static:
	<ul>
	<li><a href="Join.html">Join()</a>: It is used to pause the current thread execution until and unless the specified thread is dead. This method is called inside a thread and on the other thread which needs to be completed before the other thread</li>
	<li><a href=""></a></li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Static: The below methods work on the currently executing thread. So there is no point in invoking these methods on some other threads that are in wait state. 
	<ul>
	<li><a href="Sleep.html">Sleep()</a>: This method is used to stop execution of a thread for a specified interval.</li>
	<li><a href="Yield.html">Yield()</a>: This method causes the currently executing thread object to temporarily pause and allow other threads to execute.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Thread Synchronization:</b> This is achieved by creating a monitor/lock object that will be used to synchronized the behavior of three threads. This involves proper use of keyword synchronized and methods wait(), notify() and notifyAll() on the shared monitor object.</p>
Some other synchronization techniques in JAVA are: 
<ul>
	<li><a href="Lock.html">Lock interface</a></li>
	<li><a href="ReentrantLock.html">Reentrant Lock</a></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Fairness:</b> It is a boolean property given during creation of a lock object. If this is set as true this will make sure that the longest waiting thread is given the highest priority</p>
<p><b>ThreadGroup:</b> Grouping multiple threads into a single object so that a single method call cab be used to suspend, resume or interrupt all the threads</p>
<p><b>Shutdown Hook:</b> This is used to perform clean up operations when JVM shuts down abruptly or normally. It can be called by using Runtime.addShutdownHook(Thread hook) method.

<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p><b>What is the difference between Process and Thread?</b></p>
<p>Process is a self contained complete execution environment where as thread is a single task getting executed independently inside a process.</p>
<p><b>What is difference between calling start() and calling run() method on Thread class</b></p>
<p>A new thread is created on calling start() method on the thread object where as no thread is created on calling the run() method directly.</p>
<p><b>How can we make sure main() is the last thread to finish in Java Program?</b></p>
<p>This can be done by calling join() on all the other threads inside main method</p>
<p><b>Why are sleep() and yield() methods static?</b></p>
<p>The sleep() and yield() methods work on the currently executing thread. So there is no point of invoking these methods on some other threads that are in wait state. Hence they are declared as static methods.</p>
<p><b>What is the difference between yield(), sleep() and join() methods?</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Yield() and sleep() methods are static where as join() method is non-static</li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p><b>How to resolve the compilation error message "No enclosing instance of type X is accessible. Must qualify the allocation with an enclosing instance of type X"</b></p>
<p>This issue occurs in case one is trying to create an instance of an inner class without having an instance of outer class. Create an instance of outer class and then use that instance to create instance of the inner class. E.g.</p>
<pre>
package com.arsoft.projects.common.learning.multithreading;

public class MyThreadGroup{

	class ShutDownHook extends Thread{

		@Override
		public void run() {
			System.out.println("Shutdown hook is called");			
		}
		
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		MyThreadGroup test = new MyThreadGroup();
		Runtime runtime = Runtime.getRuntime(); 
		runtime.addShutdownHook(<b>test.new ShutDownHook()</b>);
	}

}
</pre>
<p><b>How to resolve runtime exception "java.lang.IllegalMonitorStateException" while using object.wait</b></p>
<p>Make sure that the wait() method is called inside a synchronized block.</p>
