<p>Difference between Lock and synchronized</p>
<ul>
<li>synchronized is used within a single method where as lock on an object can be obtained and closed in different methods</li>
<li>synchronized does not support fairness where as fairness can be provided as boolean parameter in the constructor of the lock class to grant access to the longest-waiting thread.</li>
<li>A thread is blocked if it does not get access to synchronized block where as lock api is having a tryLock() method which makes sure that thread acquires lock only if it's available and not held by any other thread.</li>
</ul>
